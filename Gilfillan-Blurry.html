    <h1>Blurry by Puddle of Mudd</h1>
    <HR>
        <p>Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake<br>
            And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up<br>
            Preoccupied without you, I cannot live at all<br>
            My whole world surrounds you, I stumble and I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd9OhYroLN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crawl</a></p>
            <p>You could be my someone, you could be my scene<br>
            You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene<br>
            I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are<br>
            There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean">Oceans</a> in between us, but that's not very far</p>
           <p> <strong>Can you take it all away?<br>
            Can you take it all away?<br>
            Well, you shoved it in my face<br>
            This pain you gave to me<br>
            Can you take it all away?<br>
            Can you take it all away?<br>
            Well, you shoved it in my face</strong></p>
            <p>Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real<br>
            So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel<br>
            'Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all<br>
            My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl<br>
            You could be my someone, you could be my scene<br>
            You know that I will save you from all of the unclean<br>
            I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are<br>
            There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far</p>
